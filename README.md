# CodeAlpha_Mini-Project---Prototype-Design
This project is part of my internship’s Task 3 requirement — to create a mini clickable prototype using a Figma theme. The goal was to design an interactive personal portfolio that showcases my work as an AI and Software Developer, while demonstrating my ability to adapt, customize, and prototype within existing UI frameworks.
